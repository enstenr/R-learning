#1 Data Analysis
## question 1.
The following data contains the lengths of snapper1 from the Hauraki Gulf in centimetres.
(a) Copy and paste this data into R. Do NOT type it in yourself.
fish = c(73.88, 49.24, 38.63, 42.71, 33.36, 59.68, 57.27, 36.86, 59.93,
70.21, 52.86, 47.28, 38.17, 72.27, 33.62, 55.57, 57.59, 66.18, 46.67,
75.72, 48.88, 61.81, 45.97, 59.99, 57.20, 37.50, 48.32, 89.96, 56.52,
31.90, 36.00, 70.52, 50.23, 63.35, 55.44, 60.59, 53.75, 45.11, 55.89,

```{r}
fish = c(73.88, 49.24, 38.63, 42.71, 33.36, 59.68, 57.27, 36.86, 59.93,

```

How many snapper lengths are represented in the dataset? (Hint: use length(x))

```{r}
length(fish)
```
What type/s of graph would be appropriate for representing this data? Discuss.
```{r}
plot(fish)

```
When plotting the fish, we do not see any correlation as the plots are scattered.


plot(fish)

```

Next lets try to print the table to check the count of records for each length 

```
```{r}
table(fish)
```
The above doesnt give meaningful insights as the count for each length is one. So we move on to the next plot. 

Next lets plot the histogram and to verify it manually lets sort the data to check the frequency roughly 
```{r}
hist(fish,col = "orange", breaks = 20 )

sort(fish)
table(fish)


```
Next to see the outlier whether any fish is outside the range, we can plot the boxplot 
'''{r}
boxplot(fish)
```

we observe that one fish is outside the range or in outlier. lets now manually find out the outlier value 
```{r}
quantiles <- quantile(fish,prob = c(0.25,0.5,0.75))
quantiles


```
Lets calcualte InterQuartile Range and then print the lower and upper range  
```{r}
IQR_val <- IQR(fish)
IQR_val

quantiles[[1]]-1.5*IQR_val

quantiles[[3]] + 1.5*IQR_val

boxplot(fish)
```
we observe that one fish has lengthless than the minimum outlier level. This can be seen from the boxplot
